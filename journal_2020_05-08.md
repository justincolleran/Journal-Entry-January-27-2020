## Things I learned today
- the job decided to focus on passages from Walden, Versions E and F, in the chapter called "The Pond"
- I was tasked with working on the timeline portion of the assignment
- Today I analyzed the passage from Version E, and tomorrow I plan on working on Version F
- I really enjoy working on the timeline, it is really easy to use and for someone who is not that tech savy, that is really important
