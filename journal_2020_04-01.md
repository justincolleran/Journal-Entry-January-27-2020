## Things I Learned Today
- Today, I found a passage that was interesting to me in Walden, and looked at the changes he made. I chose the second paragraph in the passage "Reading"
- I also got ahead of the game and did my practice Timeline using Gleick's "The Information.
- the TimelineJS website is pretty useful to use and it was actually kind of fun to see how my timeline came out.
